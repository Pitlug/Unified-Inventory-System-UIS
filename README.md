# Unified-Inventory-System-UIS

- We are striving to create a software solution to manage all of the internal inventory operations in your company.
- This software enables users to **add**, **edit**, **delete**, and **track** inventory effectivly with stock levels, item categories, and orders.
- UIS is planned to unify multiple aspects of inventory management into a centralized platform.

# System Requirements & Goals

1. **Add Inventory:**
    - Users can add new items to an inventory database, specifying details such as name, quantity, category, and supplier.
2. **View Inventory by Category:**
    - Users can filter and view current stock by their respective categories.
3. **Edit Inventory Records:**
    - Users can modify existing inventory records to maintain accuracy. 
4. **Delete Inventory Records:**
    - Users can remove outdated or incorrect entries from the database.
5. **Track Ordered Items:**
    - The system allows users to view items that have been ordered from the manufacturer but have not been added to the inventory yet.
